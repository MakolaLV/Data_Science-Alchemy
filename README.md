## Welcome to My Data Science Alchemy Repository! - Portfolio

Here, I explore the science of turning raw datasets into meaningful predictions, insights, and automation. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data scientist.This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Science related topics.

## Why Alchemy?  
"Alchemy" suggests the magical transformation of raw data into valuable insights. Itâ€™s a metaphor that draws from the ancient pursuit of turning base metals into gold, symbolizing how data scientists unlock hidden patterns and knowledge from seemingly ordinary datasets.
